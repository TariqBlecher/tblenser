put in a test to check that the density at r1 is m_solar mass (although this is not a catch all test)

Parallelisation : 1105 vs 1305.. my first parallel implementation is slower than serial :(

Sims - parralelising Ben says don't use threadpool for python code use NUMBA

checks done:

Just check rotation interpolation for conservation of density -> accurate to below 0.1 %

For low HI mass, sampling is worse ~ 2.5% of total flux

[optional] Photo-ionisation-flux thresholding. Talking with Josh. He says there is mixed evidence about photo ionisation. sometimes there seems to be a sharp edge and sometimes not. I suppose there are different UV backgrounds at different parts of the universe. Discussion of source thresholding. The way I'm doing it at the moment is only fine because I only consider magnification and not flux..but flux is actually slightly wrong now. I kind of want to turn off the normalisation anyway.
