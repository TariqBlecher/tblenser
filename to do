Think about normalisation and units and summed fluxes.

rdisk estimates very high. - compare to data.

change working directory when running code. output is clogging up coding folder

Plot Mag vs HI FWHM as rdisk is perhaps not the most explanatory. 

put in a test to check that the density at r1 is m_solar mass (although this is not a catch all test)

checks done:

Just check rotation interpolation for conservation of density -> accurate to below 0.1 %

For low HI mass, sampling is worse ~ 2.5% of total flux
