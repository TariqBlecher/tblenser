HIDisk is taking toooo long. npix of cats grid is too large. need to rather just interpolate onto it.
GOing back to the original hidisk, write to fits (try use astropy module), then calc image using the source fits.
This will be nice and accurate too.

Stellar mass uncertainties not properly done. using uniform sampling for now

correct z sampling for being > cluster and < band end
