## `tblenser`

`tblenser` simulates the gravitational lensing of extra-galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) by foreground galaxies or clusters. 

It can handle arbitrary lenses and is primarily focused on forward modelling, i.e. given a deflection map and a source model, it calculates the lensed image. 

It can simulate HI disks using the [Obreschkow et al. (2009)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2526) model, and marginalise over HI disk parameters through random sampling.

This software has been used in [Blecher et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz224), with more results to come.
