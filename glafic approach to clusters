The major problem here is that the HIDiscs represented as tiny gaussians would require a
1. A huge number of sources to be ray traced as in the case of the galaxy lens
2. A huge number of pixels to be evaluated.
As the ray tracing was already taking on the order of days, it would take the same amount of time to just do a single ray tracing

So we would only be able to use a handful of sersic sources. SO would have to fit with a sersic profile then ray trace that and follow through with
the errors on the fit
